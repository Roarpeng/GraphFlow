# GraphFlow for Claude Code

Use GraphFlow as a local orchestration and context service.

## Recommended setup

Add a local MCP server entry that launches GraphFlow over stdio:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "graphflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "graphflow-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

During repository development you can also point Claude Code at this checkout:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "graphflow": {
      "command": "npm",
      "args": ["run", "start:mcp"],
      "cwd": "."
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage guidance

- Ask GraphFlow to plan before broad changes: `graphflow_plan`.
- Ask GraphFlow to compress and anchor code context: `graphflow_preview_context`.
- Ask GraphFlow to inspect graph state or skill learnings when the repo history matters.
- Fall back to `graphflow ... --json` only if MCP is not available.
